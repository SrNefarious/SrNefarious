# nsb.py is the python bot code used as reference for creating bot.py
# The problems that are being faced right now...
# in the search requirement option We are trying to take user input and proceed accordingly in a chain like manner to access information from the database
# but are unable to continue the chain after first link itself. i believe it is due to incorrect use of callbackQuery function
# the other problem is that in the check status option the back button is not working (got no idea why??)
